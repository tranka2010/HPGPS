	- a set of binary files (.hp) under the "bin" directory.
	- a set of text files (.txt) under the "txt" direcory.

	Both directories contains the exact same software (as extracted directly from
	my calculator using Conn4x). I have provided both formats for the benefits of the user.  

	Make sure to read the users guide included before installing and using.

	Enjoy!
